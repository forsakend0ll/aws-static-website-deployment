# AWS Cloud Cost Calculator with Lambda, S3, SNS, EventBridge, and CloudWatch

This project demonstrates how to automate **AWS cost tracking, reporting, and alerting** using serverless AWS services under the **Free Tier**.  
It includes **weekly report generation**, **cost alerts**, and **automated scheduling** with EventBridge.

## Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](docs/architecture-diagram.gif)

The system operates without manual intervention ‚Äî once deployed, it retrieves cost data, generates reports, and sends notifications automatically.

---

## AWS Services Used

- **AWS Lambda** ‚Äì Retrieves AWS cost data from Cost Explorer, generates weekly cost reports, and sends SNS alerts  
- **Amazon S3** ‚Äì Stores generated reports in `/reports/` folder  
- **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)** ‚Äì Sends email notifications when reports are uploaded or when billing thresholds are exceeded  
- **Amazon EventBridge** ‚Äì Schedules Lambda execution on a weekly basis (every 7 days)  
- **Amazon CloudWatch** ‚Äì Monitors billing metrics and triggers alerts when total estimated charges exceed the threshold  
- **AWS Cost Explorer** ‚Äì Provides granular billing and usage data for the report

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Setup Summary

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create an S3 Bucket
- Name: `cloud-cost-tracker-cloudwithpaula`
- Create folder: `/reports/`
- Ensure the **Lambda IAM role** has `s3:PutObject` permissions

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create an SNS Topic
- Topic name: `CostAlerts`
- Add an **email subscription** and confirm via your inbox  
- Note down the **Topic ARN** for Lambda environment variable configuration

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Lambda Function
- Function name: `AWS_Cost_Tracker`
- Runtime: **Python 3.12**
- Memory: **256 MB**, Timeout: **30 seconds**
- Upload file: `aws_cost_tracker.py`
- IAM permissions required:
  - `ce:GetCostAndUsage`
  - `s3:PutObject`
  - `sns:Publish`
- Add environment variables:
  - `S3_BUCKET = cloud-cost-tracker-cloudwithpaula`
  - `SNS_TOPIC_ARN = arn:aws:sns:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:CostAlerts`
- Test manually:
  - Verify S3 upload
  - Confirm SNS email alert received

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Create an EventBridge Rule
- Rule name: `WeeklyCostReportTrigger`
- Schedule: **Fixed rate of 7 days**
- Target: `AWS_Cost_Tracker` Lambda function
- Event bus: `default`
- Ensure EventBridge ‚Üí Lambda invocation permissions are auto-granted

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Configure CloudWatch Billing Alarm
- Metric: `Billing ‚Üí Total Estimated Charge ‚Üí EstimatedCharges`
- Threshold: `$5` (demo)
- Action: Send notification to SNS topic `CostAlerts`
- Verify that alert emails are sent when the threshold is exceeded

---

## ‚úÖ Verification & Results

| Test Type | Result |
|------------|---------|
| Manual Lambda execution | Report uploaded to S3 and email sent |
| EventBridge trigger | Automatic report generated successfully |
| CloudWatch billing alarm | SNS notification received |
| End-to-end workflow | Fully automated cost tracking validated |

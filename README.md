# 🌐 AWS Static Website Hosting with S3, CloudFront, Route 53, ACM, and CloudWatch

This project demonstrates how to host a **secure static website** using various AWS services under the **Free Tier**.  
It includes **SSL/TLS encryption**, **domain management**, **CDN caching**, and **monitoring**.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

---

## ☁️ AWS Services Used

- **Amazon S3** – Hosts static website files (`index.html`, `error.html`)  
- **Amazon CloudFront** – CDN for global content delivery and HTTPS encryption  
- **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** – Provides free SSL/TLS certificates for secure HTTPS  
- **Amazon Route 53** – Manages the custom domain and DNS records  
- **Amazon CloudWatch** – Logs and monitors CloudFront activity for analytics and performance insight

## 🌍 Example Website URL

🔗 **https://cloudwithpaula.click**  
*(This website was hosted temporarily for demonstration purposes using AWS Free Tier resources.)*

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Setup Summary

### 1. Create an S3 Bucket
- Name the bucket after your domain name (e.g., `cloudwithpaula.click`)
- Enable **Static website hosting**
- Upload `index.html` and `error.html`
- Make the bucket **publicly accessible**

### 2. Request a Certificate (ACM)
- Go to **AWS Certificate Manager**
- Request a certificate in **us-east-1 (N. Virginia)** for your domain and `www` subdomain
- Validate using **DNS via Route 53**
- Wait for the certificate to be **Issued**

### 3. Create a CloudFront Distribution
- Origin domain: select your **S3 website endpoint**
- Attach your **ACM certificate** (from us-east-1)
- Add both domain names: `cloudwithpaula.click` and `www.cloudwithpaula.click`
- Redirect **HTTP → HTTPS**

### 4. Configure Route 53
- Create an **A record (alias)** pointing your domain to the CloudFront distribution
- Optionally add a **CNAME record** for `www`

### 5. Enable CloudWatch Logging
- Go to **CloudFront → General → Logging and monitoring**
- Create an **Access log delivery** to an S3 bucket
- View logs in **CloudWatch Logs**

## 💰 Teardown & Cost Management

To stay within the **AWS Free Tier**, disable or delete resources after testing:

- Delete the **CloudFront distribution**
- Delete the **S3 bucket** (after downloading your files)
- Delete your **Route 53 hosted zone** (if not needed)
- Remove the **ACM certificate** if no longer used
- Disable **CloudWatch logs** to avoid storage costs

> 🧹 *All actions can be reversed if you wish to redeploy later.*

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Deployed a static website using AWS global infrastructure  
- Configured **HTTPS** using AWS Certificate Manager and CloudFront  
- Managed **DNS routing** with Route 53  
- Implemented **CloudWatch logging** for observability  
- Practiced **cost-efficient cloud resource management**
